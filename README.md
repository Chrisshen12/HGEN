## Requirements

#### 1. Neural network libraries for GNNs

* [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
* [pytorch-geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)

Please check your cuda version first and install the above libraries matching your cuda. If possible, we recommend to install the latest versions of these libraries.

## Data preparation

* HGB datasets for node classification

These datasets include four medium-scale datasets. Please download them from pytorch geometric [pytorch-geometric-dataset](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.3/modules/datasets.html#heterogeneous-datasets).

* Ogbn-mag
It is a large dataset from [OGB Challenge](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/leader_nodeprop/#ogbn-mag).
